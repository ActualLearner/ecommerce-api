Registration (Frontend -> Backend):
The frontend sends a POST request to POST /api/v1/auth/users/ (a new Djoser endpoint).
The request body contains email, first_name, last_name, and password.
Djoser's view creates a new CustomUser with is_active=False.
The backend sends an activation email to the user's address. The link in the email will point to your frontend, e.g., https://alxpd.aymenab.com/activate/OQ/axb2-some-token/.
The API returns a 201 Created response.
Activation (User -> Frontend -> Backend):
The user opens their email and clicks the activation link.
They are taken to the /activate/... page on your React frontend.
The React app extracts the {uid} and {token} from the URL.
The frontend sends a POST request to POST /api/v1/auth/users/activation/ with the {uid} and {token} in the request body.
Djoser's view validates the token and, if valid, sets the user's is_active field to True.
The API returns a 204 No Content success response.
Login (Frontend -> Backend):
The user can now log in using POST /api/v1/auth/jwt/create/ with their email and password.
Since their account is is_active=True, the login will succeed, and they will receive their JWTs.
